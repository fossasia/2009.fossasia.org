This repository hosts the schematics of the Grove Shield for the Pocket Science Lab open hardware platform (PSLab).

The goal of PSLab is to create an Open Source hardware device (open on all layers) and software applications that can be used for experiments by teachers, students and scientists. Our tiny pocket lab provides an array of instruments for doing science and engineering experiments. It provides functions of numerous measurement tools including an oscilloscope, a waveform generator, a frequency counter, a programmable voltage, current source and even a component to control robots with up to four servos. The website is at: https://pslab.io

The Grove open hardware project was started by Seeed Studio. The goal is to make it easier to connect, experiment, and simplify the prototyping process. No jumpers or soldering required. There are more than 300 Grove modules, covering a wide range of applications that can fulfill a variety of needs. The documentation for Grove shields is here: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove/
